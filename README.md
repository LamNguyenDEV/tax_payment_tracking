# We will build a tax and payment tracking system for small companies such as LLC, C Corporate or S Corporate to use.

Tech stack will include user microservice pattern, including one python flask server for endpoint, which suffice that,

1/ http endpoint of post to write/insert records to table.

2/ view all records of tax payment of the year.

3/ CURD operations in UI, including insert, save, update and delete.

4/ Database we will use sqlite for simplicity. (SQL should be similar to MySQL or Postgresl)

Python flask connect with sqlite database
